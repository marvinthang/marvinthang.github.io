Hi! Welcome to my first blog post reviewing NUS modules 👋  
I’m currently a **Year 1 Computer Science** student (with a **Double Major in Mathematics**).

In my first semester, I took **5 modules (20 MCs)**:

| Module Code | Module Title                 |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| CS1101S     | Programming Methodology      |
| CS1231S     | Discrete Structures          |
| MA1521      | Calculus for Computing       |
| MA1522      | Linear Algebra for Computing |
| IS1108      | Digital and AI Ethics        |

Honestly, this is probably the **easiest semester** in my four years at NUS 💀  
But the content + workload still felt **pretty heavy** compared to similar courses at other universities (e.g. HCMUS - VNU-HCM).

I’ll review modules in terms of:
- **Workload**
- **Enjoyability**
- **Difficulty**

## CS1101S — Programming Methodology

**Lecturers:** Boyd Anderson, Martin Henz, Sanka Rasnakaya  
**T/A:** Goh Ee Chern

### Overall

| Metric       | Score |
| ------------ | ----- |
| Workload     | 9/10  |
| Enjoyability | 7/10  |
| Difficulty   | 2/10  |
| Grade        | A+    |

> **Note:** To be fair, I’m already a fairly experienced coder.  
> So my perspective is naturally different from most students.

### Grading Scheme

| Component             | Weight |
| --------------------- | -----: |
| Reading Assessment 1  |     5% |
| Midterm Assessment    |    15% |
| Reading Assessment 2  |     8% |
| Practical Assessment  |    12% |
| Final Assessment      |    30% |
| Mastery Check 1       |     3% |
| Mastery Check 2       |     3% |
| Source Academy XP     |    14% |
| Reflection Attendance |     5% |
| Studio Attendance     |     3% |
| Studio Effort         |     2% |

### Introduction
This is basically the “how to code” course for every CS student at NUS.  
I really love how well-prepared the course is by the profs and the Avenger team.

We use **Source**, which is essentially a simplified (nerfed) version of **JavaScript**.

---

### Source Academy
First, let’s talk about **Source Academy**. It’s an online IDE where students write code and complete assignments. It uses an **XP (experience points)** system to track assessment completion.

But you **don’t need to complete everything** to hit the full **24,000 XP (14%)**.  
It also has tools that help students understand what their code is doing.

---

### Lecture, Tutorial & Reflection
- Lectures: pretty good (based on slides). I didn’t attend any though (lazy lol).
- Tutorials: my tutor was funny and active. He tried to spell my name (and failed), so I told him to call me **Demen** instead.
- Mastery Check 1 & 2: free grades.
- Reflection: I have no idea what’s going on. I just go for attendance points 💀

---

### Content
If you’re new to programming, this module can feel **extreme**.  
The content is heavy and taught fast.

For me, I mostly just needed to learn:
- some JavaScript specifics
- new concepts like **CSE machine**, **T-diagram**, etc.

### Exam

| Component            | DeMen |  Max |     Median |
| -------------------- | ----: | ---: | ---------: |
| Reading Assessment 1 |  16.1 |   17 |         15 |
| Midterm Assessment   |    82 |  100 |         63 |
| Reading Assessment 2 |    62 |   95 |         43 |
| Practical Assessment |    80 |   80 |         46 |
| Final Assessment     |    94 |  100 | not public |

**RA1 & RA2** were fully MCQ.  
Especially **RA2** this year was *super tricky*, with a median of **43/95**.

**Midterm** was MCQ + code implementation (on paper).  
Fairly hard — you needed deep understanding to move fast. I lost:
- 9 points on the **T-diagram** (I didn’t get it yet)
- 3 more points on other MCQs

**Practical Assessment** was fully code implementation on Source Academy:
- 7 problems
- 100 minutes
- public tests for debugging + private tests for grading  
Last 3 were hard, but I finished everything in **70 minutes**.

**Final** was MCQ + code implementation too.  
This year’s final felt easier than previous years.

### Conclusion
If you’re completely new to programming, you need to learn this course **VERY carefully**.  
The course content is excellent for teaching how to think and design code properly.
