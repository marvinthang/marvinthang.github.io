### Midterm
**Format:** 
- Examplify Lockdown / Secure
- There are 20 MCQ/MRQ questions, and 1 Essay question with a case study. You must answer all questions.
- **Duration:** 80 mins

**Scope:** You are required to synthesize ethical principles, ethical framework, technical and governance considerations covered in the course. Scope includes the following key topics:
- Professional Ethics
- AI Ethics and Governance
- Data Privacy and Protection
- Human Computer Interaction and Ethical UX Design
- Automation and Autonomous Systems
- Ethical AI Product Management
- You are required to apply the FISh approach thoroughly, referencing ethical norms, ethical decision-making frameworks, data privacy laws such as PDPA, and embedding privacy and fairness considerations from system design to deployment. You should reflect on trade-offs via the Principle of Double Effect and illustrate mature ethical judgment consistent with IS1108 learning outcomes.

The midterm test paper is closed book with 20 MCQs/MRQs and one (1) open-ended question which will each feature a case study for students to analyze an ethical scenario in computing, and apply relevant frameworks and justify recommendations with structured reasoning.

**Expected Structure of Answers**
- Issue Identification: Start by summarizing the case background, identifying the central ethical issues, and noting any critical facts or contextual constraints.
- Stakeholder Analysis: List all relevant stakeholders, their roles, interests, and how they are affected by the scenario.
- Framework Application: Apply required ethical frameworks (e.g., FISh, Principle of Double Effect, Consequentialist, etc.) to guide decision-making and solution analysis.
- Options and Solutions: Outline possible courses of action, evaluating the pros and cons of each using evidence from the case and course content.
- Recommendation and Justification: Commit to one solution or recommendation, supporting it with logical arguments and referencing frameworks.
- Reflection: Briefly note any potential broader impact or lessons, if relevant.

**Tips:**

- Read carefully, divide questions into component tasks, and underline keywords.
- Address all elements in sequence: context, issues, stakeholder analysis, application of frameworks, evaluation, and recommendation.
- Avoid simply listing facts; demonstrate critical thinking and the ability to justify decisions.

**What Makes a Strong Answer:**

- **Clarity**: Concise and logical structure, with clear header statements for each section.
- **Evidence-Based**: Use facts from the case and course references where appropriate.
- **Framework Alignment**: Directly relate arguments to established ethical principles or guidelines discussed in class.
- Students should aim for thorough, well-supported responses addressing all stages of ethical analysis required for the computing context.

**Materials**:
- **No materials** allowed.
